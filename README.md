# BC-Search-With-Features
BigCommerce Search With Features - this is necessary because of the peculiarity of the AJAX search used by BigCommerce 2 particular issues present themselves with JS features on the expose of products in the search results grid:

1. It is difficult to choose a proper location for the features as most of the Search files are loaded twice, which causes the features to fire twice and appear duplicate in the DOM, causing all sorts of UI/UX issues.
2. The search is built on and works via AJAX.  This causes a problem when the search results pagination is used to move between pages of results.  The problem specifically is that each page of search results is freshly populated into the DOM by the AJAX function, and to these new product items in the search results grid, my JS features are not being applied as new DOM elements are left out of the flow.

####SOLUTION:
- The solution presented here is simple and two stage:
1.  Wrap all the functionality of each feature into its own named function, and call all these functions at the end of each Search-AJAX call.
2.  Wrap all the feature calls that are at the end of the Search-AJAX function into a function with a global flag that is set to true after the features are called once.
